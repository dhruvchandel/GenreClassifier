# GenreClassifier
this project is the art of deep learning. 
we worked on neural networks and using CNN and ANN we managed to make a classifier for the movie trailers into 4 genres.
namely these 4 genre types are:-
  1.Action
  2.Drama
  3.Horror
  4.Romance
  
Main flow of classifier begins with a Convolution Neural Network which classifiy video into subcategories namely:-
  1.action/fight
  2.cars
  3.drama
  4.explosion
  5.horrorscenes
  6.party
  7.robots
  8.romance

--->we train this model on DATASET MADE BY US ONLY.

next comes the part of Artificial Neural Network in which output of CNN is treated as input and we get output in the form of 4 genre percentages.
